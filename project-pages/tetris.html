				<div class="body-text">My 3D Tetris implementation started out as an OpenGL learning project. I followed the tutorial at <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a> up to the point where I could have arbitrary 3D geometry and camera movement. I used GLFW for window creation, glad for loading OpenGL, glm for 3D math, and stb_image for loading textures. Once I had that, I wrote code that can render cubes arranged in a grid, including the current falling piece. Cubes in different layers have different colors to make their position clear at a glance. Separate code handles the movement and placement of the falling piece. It also clears layers once they are filled, as expected.</div>
				<div class="body-text">The game could still use some work, including a better control control scheme, and different levels. However, I am not working on it currently. I converted it to use the module system introduced in the C++20 standard. While the current level of support for modules allowed me to build a working demo, it is not at a point where I would want to keep working with it. Once CMake recieves proper support for C++ modules, I might start working on it again. Until then, I will try to create something similar in Vulkan.</div>
